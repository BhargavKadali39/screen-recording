# screen-recording
screen recoder using python

Record your screen using python.

To start recording just run the code and enter some input for ex: "yes"

The recording starts instantaneously and press q to exit the recording or just kill the program and don't forget to close the terminal/shell or what ever you're using.
Doing so will safely save the video in the folder where the program is saved.
